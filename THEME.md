# TinkerTrack UI Theme

## Concept
Warm editorial minimalism with espresso-toned surfaces and refined serif headlines. The interface should feel composed, intimate, and purposeful—like a premium analog journal translated to a modern app shell.

## Palette (DaisyUI theme: tinkertrack)
- **Base**: warm cream surfaces with low-chroma warmth.
- **Primary**: deep espresso brown for calls-to-action.
- **Secondary**: caramel clay for supportive actions.
- **Accent**: sun-washed wheat for highlights and glows.
- **Borders**: soft separators (base-200/70) and restrained shadows.
- **Glow**: diffuse radial light using low-opacity primary/secondary.

## Typography
- **Display**: Fraunces (serif) for headlines and hero copy.
- **Body**: Source Sans 3 for readable UI text and forms.
- **Tone**: elegant but quiet; avoid overly bold or wide weights.

## Layout & Spacing
- Generous vertical spacing and calm breathing room.
- Max width: 6xl for main content.
- Align primary actions to the right in the navbar.
- Use symmetric grids with occasional soft asymmetry (floating glow or offset cards).

## Components
- **Navbar**: sticky, translucent background with subtle blur; app name + icon left, auth/profile right.
- **Cards**: soft shadow, base-200 surfaces, rounded corners, light blur.
- **Buttons**: primary for main actions, ghost for secondary links.
- **Forms**: clear labels, full-width inputs, consistent vertical rhythm.

## Motion & Effects
- Minimal motion; gentle hover state changes only.
- Background glows (blurred radial shapes) to add depth without noise.

## Do / Don’t
- **Do**: keep contrast readable, use warm neutrals, maintain serif headline moments.
- **Don’t**: introduce neon colors, hyper-saturated gradients, or sharp angular motifs.

## Usage
All new pages and components should adhere to these guidelines to maintain consistent visual identity across the site.
